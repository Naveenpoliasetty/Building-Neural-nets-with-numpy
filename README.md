# Building-Neural-nets-with-numpy

Building neural networks from scratch provides a unique perspective, akin to constructing a complex structure from its bare components. This approach allows us to dissect each element, from neurons and activation functions to weight initialization and back propagation, fostering a profound comprehension of the underlying mechanics.
Although machine learning libraries(Tensorflow/Pytorch) simplify many complexities, delving into manual implementation reveals the challenges and intricacies inherent in constructing neural networks. This hands-on exploration not only deepens readers' appreciation for the inner workings of neural networks but also equips them with the skills to customise these networks for specific tasks and datasets.
